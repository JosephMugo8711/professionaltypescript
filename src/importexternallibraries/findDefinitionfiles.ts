// With the 2.x versions of TypeScript, typings are now available from the npm @types repository. These are
// automatically resolved by the TypeScript compiler and are much simpler to use.


// To install a type deÔ¨Ånition you simply install it as a dev dependency in your projects package.json
//npm i -S lodash
//npm i -D @types/lodash

// after install you simply use the module as before

import * as _ from 'lodash'
